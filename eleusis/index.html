  <h1>Rules</h1>

<p>This is a card game by Robert Abbot. Specifically my summary here refers to New Eleusis. This card game was written up in Scientific American in about 1977.</p>

<h2>The Idea</h2>

<p>A Dealer makes up a Rule about how cards are supposed to be played. The players, by playing cards, try to figure out what the rule is. The more a player knows about the rule, the better they do in a hand.</p>

<h2>The Rule</h2>

<p>A rule basically says what card is played next and is usually based on the cards played so far. Easier rules are better than hard rules. See more below about characteristics of easy rules.</p>

<h2>Start the game</h2>

<ul>
<li>The Dealer makes up the rule</li>
<li>Deals 14 cards to each player</li>
<li>The dealer plays the first card (a good card)</li>
<li>The next card is played by the person to the left of the dealer</li>
</ul>


<h2>Correct and Incorrect cards</h2>

<ul>
<li>A player may play one to four cards</li>
<li>Incorrect cards go to the side</li>
<li>Correct cards go along the main line</li>
<li>A player receives two cards for each incorrect card played.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Example</strong> : A player plays two incorrect cards together. The dealer puts to them to the side (slightly overlapping so you can see they go together) and gives the player four cards in return.</p>

<h2>No play</h2>

<p><strong>Hint</strong> : No Play is almost never a good idea. If you think you don&rsquo;t have a good card, it&rsquo;s usually better just to play some card at random than to declare No Play.</p>

<ul>
<li>If a player thinks he doesn&rsquo;t have a card that follows the rule, he can declare No Play.</li>
<li>He shows everyone all of his cards.</li>
<li>The Dealer says whether he is right or wrong.</li>
<li>If he is wrong, the dealer takes a good card, plays it for him, and gives him five cards (replacing the card played plus four cards as a penalty).</li>
<li>If he is right, the dealer takes all of his cards and deals him new cards, but four less than before. (This could end the hand).</li>
</ul>


<p>If there is a Prophet when a player declares No Play, the rules are explained here:  <a href="/stargate/eleusis/noplay_falseprophet.html">No Play and False Prophet</a>.</p>

<h2>The Prophet</h2>

<ul>
<li>If a player thinks he knows the rule, he doesn&rsquo;t say what the rule is. Instead, he can declare himself as a Prophet.</li>
<li>When a player declares himself a Prophet, a black pawn marker goes on the last card played (good or bad).</li>
<li>The Prophet takes over the Dealer&rsquo;s job of saying whether a card is correct or incorrect.</li>
<li>The Dealer, in turn, says whether the Prophet is right.</li>
<li>A Player can only be a Prophet once during a hand.</li>
</ul>


<h2>A False Prophet</h2>

<ul>
<li>If the Prophet is wrong, he receives a five-card penalty and begins playing normally again.</li>
<li>If the player, about who&rsquo;s card(s) the Prophet was wrong, was also wrong, then he does not receive the usual two-card penalty.</li>
<li>Black markers are removed from the play area.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Counting Cards</h2>

<ul>
<li>A white pawn is placed on every 10th card played. A hand ends after 30 cards have been played.</li>
<li>If a Prophet is declared, a black King is put on the card when a prophet is declared and a black pawn on every 10th card after. A hand ends after 20 cards have been played under a prophet.</li>
<li>If a Prophet becomes a False Prophet, all of the black markers are removed and the counting goes back to just the 10th card white pawns from the start of the hand.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Ending the Hand</h2>

<p>The hand ends when:</p>

<ul>
<li>A player runs out of cards</li>
<li>There is no Prophet, and the 30th card is played</li>
<li>There is a Prophet, and the 20th card has been played since the Prophet.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Scoring</h2>

<ul>
<li>All players count the cards left in their hands</li>
<li>The maximum of these counts is the High Count.</li>
<li>Each player&rsquo;s starting score is the High Count minus the cards they have left.</li>
<li>If there was a Prophet when the hand ended, he gets one extra point for every correct card played and two extra points for every incorrect card played since he became a prophet (after the King on the board).</li>
<li>The Dealer&rsquo;s points are the &lsquo;&#8217;smaller&rsquo;&lsquo; of these two:
<strong> The highest score of all players in this hand
</strong> Double the number of cards played before a Prophet, if there was a Prophet when the game ended.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Scoring Example</h1>

<p>Players A, B, C and D.</p>

<ul>
<li>A was the Dealer</li>
<li>B was a Prophet and had 8 cards left</li>
<li>C had 10 cards left</li>
<li>D had 15 cards left</li>
</ul>


<p>The High Count is 15. The base scores are as follows, High Count minus cards left:</p>

<ul>
<li>B = 7</li>
<li>C = 5</li>
<li>D = 0</li>
</ul>


<p>After the Prophet marker, there were 8 correct cards and 7 incorrect cards. That means the Prophet gets an additional 8 + (2 * 7) = 8 + 14 = 20 points.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>B score = 7 + 20 = 27 Eighteen cards were played before the Prophet. The Dealers score is the smaller of the highest score 27 or the 18 cards, i.e., the Dealer&rsquo;s score is 18.</p></li>
<li><p>A = 18</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Final scores:</p>

<ul>
<li>A = 18</li>
<li>B = 27</li>
<li>C = 5</li>
<li>D = 0</li>
</ul>


<h2>Number of hands in a game</h2>

<ul>
<li>Ideally, all players get to be Dealer for a hand.</li>
<li>If any players don&rsquo;t get to be Dealer, they get a 10-point bonus.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Good Rules</h2>

<p>What makes a good rule?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Good rules are simple. Here are a couple of examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Alternate colors, red and black.</li>
<li>Cards are played in this order: Spade, Heart, Club, Diamond</li>
<li>An odd number has to come after a face card</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>It&rsquo;s important for a rule not to restrict too much which card can be played next. If there is only one card in a deck of 52 that can be played next, then it will take a group forever to figure it out (and the Dealer will get a low score).</p></li>
</ul>
